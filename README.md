# Mapsted Package Installation

## Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Step 1
- Open terminal and run below command

```sh
npm install
npm install mapsted-react-native
```
Please find more details here : https://www.npmjs.com/package/mapsted-react-native

## prerequisites

### iOS
- Project/ios/Podfile Add source file on top

```sh
source 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'

# To run in simulator add below source target
source 'https://github.com/Mapsted/podspec-simulator.git'

# To run in device add below source target
source 'https://github.com/Mapsted/podspec.git'
```

- Project/ios/Podfile set use frameworks in your app target

```sh
use_frameworks!
```

- Add license file in Resources folder `your_ios_license.key`

### Android

- Add license file in Assets folder('/app/src/main/assets') `your_android_license.key`

## Step 2: Update Pods

- go to ios directory and install pods with below command.
```sh
cd ios
pod install
```


## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 4: Initialize Mapsted map SDK

We need to call below function to initialize the map SDK.

**launchMapActivity()** 


## Step 5: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
